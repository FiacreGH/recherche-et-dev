Override configuration for development
---------------------------------------

While developing the website in a development context, it might be interesting to override some default values such as the domain name for instance.
It can be performed by adding configuration in directory ``Configuration/Development`` with two TS configuration files:

* setup.txt
* constants.txt

Theses two files will override the default configuration since loaded on the top.
